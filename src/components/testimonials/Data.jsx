      "`Working with Nalaka was a smooth and positive experience. He understood our vision for Monikulttuuriset Yrittäjät Ry and transformed it into a professional website that truly represents our mission of supporting immigrant entrepreneurs in Finland. The addition of a chatbot has made it easier for visitors to connect with us, and the whole process was done with great attention to detail and care. I really appreciate his dedication and creativity.` – Heiman KenZhari, Founder",

      "`Nalaka did an outstanding job in rebuilding our fire safety management system. The previous version was messy and difficult to use, but he suggested a new structure and delivered a much more reliable and user-friendly solution. He not only included all the existing features but also integrated maps and added useful improvements for managing both equipment and staff. I was very satisfied with his work and felt confident to share my future requirements with him. We are now planning to expand the system with a mobile app, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration.` – Hönikl Gerhard, Brandschutz-Brombacher (Germany)",

      "`Nalaka played a key role in developing the supplier registration system for the Ministry of Defence. Before this system, we depended on a standalone application and a lot of manual work. His Laravel-based solution allowed vendors to log in and check live status updates, while the Ministry could generate letters directly from the system, saving significant time, cost, and paperwork. He also developed an API for the Sri Lanka Army to integrate with their in-house system, which further streamlined the process. Nalaka collaborated closely with us, conducted knowledge-sharing and user training sessions, and ensured everyone could use the system effectively. His professionalism and technical expertise truly added value to our operations.` – Amila Lakmal, System Coordinator – Ministry of Defence",

Later, when I decided to change my business scope, he adapted the system and customized it to fit my new direction. I really appreciate his flexibility, problem-solving skills, and dedication to seeing projects through.` – Madhuranga Dilshan",
